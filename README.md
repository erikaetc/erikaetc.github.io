## TODO:

- Update texts
- Change color scheme
- Flexbox or CSS grid for spacing, instead of multiple breaks :D
- Each section/row/div should fill the screen. When scrolling down, it should continue to scroll so that top of next section is on top.
- Menu that pops up to the top when scrolling past it
- "To top"-button in one of the lower corners, on top of page all the time unless top meny section is visible

                    <h2> My adventure in NYC </h2>
                    <p>
                        From 5th of September to 29th of November, me and my fiancé will be staying in New York. He will be working at his company's NY office
                        and I will head out on a programming adventure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As I see it, my adventure in NYC has two main ingredients; <a href="#journey_woman">Journeywoman company visits</a> and <a href="#what_else">my own projects</a>.
                    </p>

                </div>

                <div id="journey_woman">
                    <h3> - The Journeywoman</h3>
                    <p>
                        I'm looking to do a "journeywoman" - visit different companies during shorter periods of time, working with them (for free), trying
                        to learn as much as I possibly can.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My inspiration to do this and to write about it comes from <a href="http://codecoupled.org/2015/05/06/announcing-my-journeymanship/">Lennart Fridén/</a>,
                        who in his turn was inspired by <a href="http://www.techhumans.com/2012/07/27/interview-with-corey-haines-august-2011/">Corey Haines</a>. Lennart actually
                        <a href="http://codecoupled.org/2015/07/08/journeyman-transmode/">visited our company/</a> in beginning of July on his journeyman.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm looking for companies to visit during my stay in NYC, would you be able to host me?
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div id="what_else">
                    <h3> - My own programming projects </h3>
                    <p>
                        I have started developing my own app in Java (<a href="https://github.com/erikaetc/outfitplanner">Github</a> / <a href="https://trello.com/b/zGglMdzd/outfitplanner">Trello</a> )
                        so I'm going to spend some time in NYC working on it. Some of the time I'll be coding at home but I'm hoping to find other people in the same situation who also want to meet and code.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        NYC also has a lot of <a href="http://www.meetup.com/">meetups</a>, so I'm going to attend some of them to get inspired and learn even more.
                    </p>

                    <h3> Goals: </h3>
                    <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>More knowledge and better confidence in what I know and do not know.</li>
                        <li>Get some practical knowledge.</li>
                        <li>Try new ways of working.</li>
                        <li>See how other companies work to get inspiration.</li>
                        <li>Work with some of my favourite product companies.</li>
                    </ul>

                <div id="q_n_a">
                    <h2> Q&A: </h2>

                    <h3> Why NYC? </h3>
                    <p>
                        Well, first of all: NYC is an awesome city. I went there in 2002 with my parents and have always wanted to go back to experience it as an adult (I was 16 back then).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now my fiancé (who is also working as a software developer) got a chance to spend some time at <a href="http://www.trioptima.com/contact/offices/New-York.html">their NYC office</a>.
                    </p>

                    <h3> Are you unemployed? </h3>
                    <p>
                        No, <a href="http://www.transmode.com">my employer</a> let me be off of work for these three months.
                    </p>

                    <h3> They let you do that?! </h3>
                    <p>
                        Yes, Swedish companies do such things. My boss is very supportive! <3
                    </p>

                    <h3> Will you work in NYC? </h3>
                    <p>
                        No, because of multiple reasons. We are going on a ESTA via the Visa Waiver program, which forbids me to work in USA during our stay.
                        But I would love to spend some time <a href="#journey_woman">with "unpaid internships" at some companies</a>!
                    </p>

                    <h3> But how will you pay for living and food and...stuff?! </h3>
                    <p>
                        I have been saving for this trip plus I get my vacation salary (in Sweden you get money also while on vacation and 1/3 of my time is on vacation), so that'll be paying for food, transportation,
                        training and entertainment. Since we're going through my fiancé's company they are organizing our living.
                    </p>

                    <h3> So will you be coding all the time? </h3>
                    <p>
                        A lot of the time but not all the time! At home I do a lot of different sports and exercising since I'm into modern pentathlon. This will of course continue in New York as well;
                        I'm joining a fencing club and will be out discovering the streets of New York in my running shoes. Plus there's a lot to see so I'll keep myself busy!
                    </p>

        <h2> My adventure in NYC </h2>
        <p>
            From 5th of September to 29th of November, me and my fiancé will be staying in New York. He will be working at his company's NY office
            and I'm looking to do a "journeywoman" - visit different companies during shorter periods of time, working with them (for free), trying
            to learn as much as I possibly can.
            <br>
            My inspiration to do this and to write about it comes from <a href="http://codecoupled.org/2015/05/06/announcing-my-journeymanship/">Lennart Fridén/</a>,
            who was inspired by <a href="http://www.techhumans.com/2012/07/27/interview-with-corey-haines-august-2011/">Corey Haines</a>. Lennart actually
            <a href="http://codecoupled.org/2015/07/08/journeyman-transmode/">visited our company/</a> in beginning of July on his journeyman.

            As I see it, the programming part of my adventure in NYC has two ingredients; <a href="#journey_woman">Journeywoman company visits</a> and <a href="#what_else">my own project</a>.
        </p>

    </div>

    <div class="container" id="journey_woman">
        <h3> - The Journeywoman</h3>
        <p>
            I'm looking for companies to visit during my stay in NYC, would you be able to host me?
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="container" id="what_else">
        <h3> - My own programming projects </h3>
        <p>
            I'm developing my own app in Java (<a href="https://github.com/erikaetc/outfitplanner">Github</a> / <a href="https://trello.com/b/zGglMdzd/outfitplanner">Trello</a> )
            so I'm going to work a lot on that. Part of the time I'll be sitting at home but I'm hoping to find other people in the same situation who also want to meet and code.
            <br>
            NYC also has a lot of <a href="http://www.meetup.com/">meetups</a>, so I'm going to attend a lot them to get inspired and learn even more.
        </p>

        <h2> Q&A: </h2>

        <h3> Why NYC? </h3>
        <p>
            My fiancé, who is also working as a software developer, got a chance to spend some time at <a href="http://www.trioptima.com/contact/offices/New-York.html">their NYC office</a>.
        </p>

        <h3> Are you unemployed? </h3>
        <p>
            No, <a href="http://www.transmode.com">my employer</a> let me be off of work for these three months.
        </p>

        <h3> They let you do that?! </h3>
        <p>
            Yes, Swedish companies do such things. My boss is very supportive! <3
        </p>

        <h3> Will you work in NYC? </h3>
        <p>
            No, because of multiple reasons. We are going on a ESTA via the Visa Waiver program, which forbids me to work in USA during our stay.
            But I would love to do <a href="#journey_woman">unpaid internships</a> at some companies!
        </p>

        <h3> But how will you pay for living and food and...stuff?! </h3>
        <p>
            Savings & salary (in Sweden you get money also while on vacation and 1/3 of my time is on vacation) pay for food, training and entertainment, and my fiancé's company is paying for our apartment.
        </p>

        <h3> ... </h3>
        <p>
            At home I do a lot of different sports and exercising since I'm into modern pentathlon. This will of course continue in New York as well;
            I'm joining a fencing club and will be out discovering the streets of New York in my running shoes.
